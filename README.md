# A Practical GitOps example

Consider this repository as an example of how one could implement a service using a GitOps approach.
It demonstrates how a service can be built up in a mono repository and where GitOps is achieved by building the pipelines
thereafter.

The intention is that this repository is used as an example together with by blog post series at [teashaped.dev](http://teashaped.dev), which points to specific tags to show the journey of building up a GitOps pipeline.
